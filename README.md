# Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Algorithms Repository! This repository contains a collection of hand-written algorithms implemented in various programming languages. These algorithms serve as references and examples for solving common problems in computer science and programming.

## Algorithms

The following table provides an overview of the algorithms available in the repository and the programming languages they are implemented in:

| Algorithm                          | Python | C++ |
|------------------------------------|--------|-----|
| K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)          |   ✅   |  ✅ |
| Principal Component Analysis (PCA) |        |  ✅ |
| Gradient Descent                   |   ✅   |  ✅ |


**Note**: The checkboxes indicate whether the algorithm is implemented in a particular programming language.



## Contributing

Contributions to the Algorithms Repository are welcome! If you would like to contribute an algorithm implementation or make improvements to the existing code, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository and create a new branch for your contribution.
2. Implement or modify the algorithm in your preferred programming language.
3. Ensure that your code follows the established coding style and guidelines.
4. Add documentation comments to explain the algorithm's purpose, inputs, outputs, and any other relevant information.
5. Test your implementation with example inputs and, if applicable, include test cases.
6. Submit a pull request to the main repository with a clear description of your contribution.

Your contribution will be reviewed and merged if it meets the repository's quality standards and guidelines.
